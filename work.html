      <h2 class="subtitle">How we calculate your alcohol level</h2>
      <p>We start by taking all the different needed values, the amount of glasses of alcohol you have had.
        Because each respective glass contains (roughly) the same amount of alcohol (1 shot of strong liqour has as much alcohol as 1 beer!) we can
        easily take this amount. Then we need to know whether you're male or female because this changes the speed your body brakes the alcohol down.
        After We just need your weight and the amount of hours since the last drink. We then use the following formula: <br><br>
        Alcohol level = ( (amount of glasses * 10) / (weight * r) ) - ( (hours - 0.5) * (weight * 0.002) ) <br><br>

        Where r depends on whether you're male (0.7) or female (0.5). <br><br>

        Some extra general information: <br>
        Starting driver max = 0.2 <br>
        Normal driver max = 0.5 <br> <br>
