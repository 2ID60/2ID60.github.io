       Why don't you grab a cab? Your current promillage is (NUMBER) and that's to high.
       As a starting driver your promillage should not be over 0.2. Start driving now and
       you could face a hefty fine of upto <strong>650 euros</strong>! Also by driving now
       you would <strong>endager</strong> yourself and others on the road. Maybe get an uber?

     <h2 class="subtitle">If you're not a starting driver:</h2>
     <div class="notification is-warning">
       Your promillage is still within the levels (below 0.5) but you have still have
       been drinking so it might be a better idea to grab a cab anyway? Even a tiny
       bit of alcohol can heavily influence your driving skills. If you drive, take
       extra care!
